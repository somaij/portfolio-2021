Hey there, I'm Jason. I currently work at Hydro One as a UX Designer & Developer, where I get to use my skills to create webpages that excite and help our customers.

I also take on a variety of side projects to further enhance my design and development abilities, such as the site you find yourself on now, or the [website I designed for my friend's mosque](/work/islamic-forum-of-canada/), or this site I made for my [fianc√©](https://sarahjokhu.com/). In 2018 I took a [Brainstation User Experience Design course](/work/guideo/) that provided me with foundational UX knowledge that I continue to use everyday.

I'm a huge car nerd (Golf GTI driver), video game lover and I like to golf, with my Golf.
