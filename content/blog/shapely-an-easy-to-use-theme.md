## Why Do I Need a Website?

The number of tech people that I've met that "don't need a website" astounds me. Whilst taking Systems Analyst in college and **IT** in university, the majority of my peers didn't have a website to sell their skills to potential employers. I'm glad to say at least some of them listened and created their own online presence.

But what about non-tech people? [Here's a 2013 Forbes article on why everyone needs a website](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/26/why-every-job-seeker-should-have-a-personal-website-and-what-it-should-include/#3bcb0dea119e). Controlling your first impression online is paramount to creating a professional image of yourself.

Okay, I'll stop preaching and assume you're on board by now.

## The Theme

Your first instinct is probably to gravitate to this thing you've heard about - **WordPress**. The platform was originally made for blogging, but a lot of organizations use it as a content management system because of how easy it is to use. The best part is the vast amount of customization because of themes and plugins. A lot of these are free, but a lot are not. If you're on a free hosting plan like x10hosting, you're probably not going to get any free theme pack-ins with your WordPress install. 

For the past couple of weeks I've been searching for a free theme to set up my cousin's website. I didn't want to put in a lot of work (he had a whopping budget of $0!), but the free themes I came across were frankly, ugly. Until I came across Colorlib's theme - **[Shapely](https://colorlib.com/wp/themes/shapely/)**. I was in love with the shape of it.

It has a simple set up wizard that guides you through installing it's required plugins. I'm not a fan of page builders, but this one was bearable because it uses built in WordPress features to get the job done, decreasing the bloat. Their [demo](https://colorlib.com/shapely/) is a good showcase of it's capabilities. Personally I only used the parallax banner with a free stock image, and the contact form 7 widget.

For my cousin's resume page, I used a Word to HTML online converter, and pasted it in. You can also just use the regular editor and paste it in straight from Word - I just wanted to refine the design a bit.

After that, I just simply linked the resume page in the menu. There's also a feature to create a social media menu that automatically creates icons for you in the footer. [Here's a link to the very helpful documentation](https://colorlib.com/wp/support/shapely/).

Here was the end result. Not too bad for an hour's work!

<a href="#img1" id="img-1-link" class="lightbox-link"><img class="inline-image height-400" src="/assets/chris-preview.jpg"/></a><a href="#img-1-link" class="lightbox" id="img1"><span style="background-image: url('/assets/chris-preview.jpg')"></span></a>

## Recommended Plugins

Oh, and before you go, here's a list of plugins I think are **essential**. They're all free so don't worry!

* [Yoast SEO](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) - You need to control how your search results show up on Google. It's important!
* [WP Smush](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/) - Decreases image size automatically. Smaller images = faster site.
* [Wordfence](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) - The bad thing about WordPress is that when left unchecked it becomes open to vulnerabilites. But Wordfence should help with that.
