summary: >-
  Being the central hub for the community’s members to get information online,
  there are many objectives that this redesign needs to fulfill. As an outsider
  to the Islamic community, this was a great challenge that helped me refine my
  UCD skills.

  1. Be great to look at, and extremely easy to use due to the wide demographic of users.

  2. Automate or simplify as many tasks as possible to free up the managing team’s time. Things such as donations, creating events, special function requests (marriage for example)

  3. Gather donations

  4. Let members quickly check the current daily prayer times.

  5. Sell members on their school programs

  6. Present Islam in a non-daunting way to Canadian-Muslims and be an informational resource for the Mosque.
