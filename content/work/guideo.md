summary: "[During my 5 weeks at
  Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/course/toronto/user-experience-design),
  our class was given the assignment to create a transit app. It was left up to
  us to find a transit problem, and solve it with the skills and digital tools
  learned in class. For this project we used the **[human centered
  design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design)** approach which
  included identifying problems in current user experiences by user interviews
  and testing our solutions by having users navigate rough sketches (using the
  [Marvel ](https://marvelapp.com/)app) and low fidelity wireframes (using
  [Moqups](https://moqups.com))."
