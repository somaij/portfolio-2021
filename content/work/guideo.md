summary: "[During my 5 weeks at
  Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/course/toronto/user-experience-design),
  our class was given the assignment to create a transit app. It was left up to
  us to find a transit problem, and solve it with the skills and digital tools
  learned in class. For this project we used the **[human centered
  design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design)** approach which
  included identifying problems in current user experiences by user interviews
  and testing our solutions by having users navigate rough sketches (using the
  [Marvel ](https://marvelapp.com/)app) and low fidelity wireframes (using
  [Moqups](https://moqups.com))."

      The first step in the process was finding out what the problem was in the
      first place! I interviewed 4 people, with this set of questions:


      1. What is your name?

      2. Where do you live? And work?

      3. Describe the last time you walked somewhere.

      4. What apps do you use to navigate?

      5. What makes you walk over using public transit?

      6. What do you wish you could change about the process of navigating somewhere?

      7. What information do you wish was readily available?


      I then found some common issues that my interviewees shared:


      1. Transfers were a hassle due to delays and misinformation.

      2. Navigation apps would only provide a set of immutable routes. Users couldn't change parts of a route, so that they could walk halfway instead of using a streetcar.

      3. Detailed information such as a route being presto only or pricing information wasn't easily found.

      4. Uber was expensive, and Uber Pool didn't prioritize getting users there on time.


      Surprisingly, none of my interviewees didn't mind walking 20 minutes if they didn't need to take another streetcar or bus.
