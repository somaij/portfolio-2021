      This was the first page I redesigned for TLA. The original version used an
      accordion style popout when clicking on book covers, which would shift
      elements on the page around. I liked the concept of drawing in users with
      the cover, so I changed the accordion to a simple
      [lightcase.js](https://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/) gallery lightbox.

      Below that, we included e-books and audio books by Bookboon. These proved to be super popular - our learners liked reading and listening at their own pace, so our team decided to turn it into a monthly program. Later on, it became the main focus of the page, so the order was flipped.

    sectionText: >-
      One of our more important pages - the purpose of this one is to guide our
      users to LinkedIn learning, as well as pique their interest with LinkedIn
      content. 


      ### Header


      <img src="/assets/original-lil.png" class="centered-image height-400"/>


      The beautiful header graphic was designed by my colleague, Joe Morris. I integrated it as naturally as possible, leaving the left side to house our main and secondary CTA's. Directly below that is some more copy to convince our users to get on LinkedIn Learning, and featured courses that our team hand-picked.


      However as time went on, we discovered through Google Analytics that most users weren't interacting with our featured content. The page was simplified, and today looks like this instead.

      The champions section was further down on the page, but it actually had more interactivity. A champion is an employee that has submitted a course to be shared to fellow employees. The social nature of this program reigned supreme, and replaced the featured content completely. We also shortened the copy as LinkedIn became more popular, and added in a in-page sticky navbar to let our users jump around the page more easily.


      The rest of the page didn't have drastic changes. 


      ### Learning Journeys


      The TLA is backed by several deans - high ranking employees from across our brands who collaborate with us. TLA's main purpose is to drive employees to keep learning, and testimonials from our deans about on-going learning help to reinforce that purpose.

      Below that is another set of points about LinkedIn Learning, in case the user is scrolling the entire page (actually, a number of our users tend to use the CTA at the bottom of the page, surprisingly).


      ### Video Tutorials


      If anyone has trouble with LinkedIn Learning, we send them to this spot on the page. We've created some videos on how to use the main aspects of LinkedIn Learning, such as logging in and linking your account, showing certificates, etc.

      Also, as noted in the previous section, the bottom CTA is pretty popular.
