      **Example Page Design:**
      <https://www.figma.com/proto/QrlpWnH7QxHRNjLTV5lrg8/Applicance-%26-Energy-Savings-Tips?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2-61&viewport=1164%2C1217%2C0.41&scaling=min-zoom>


      **F﻿inal Page:** <https://www.hydroone.com/saving-money-and-energy/residential/tips-and-tools/appliances>


      The first set of pages I focused on was the tips and tricks section of the hydroone.com website. As I worked on the first page in the roster, Cooling tips and tricks, I scoured the website to find the similar elements between each and found a way to bring a consistent look to each page. These pages are featured in our monthly newsletter.

      In each masthead, I've brought a consistent call to action, a clear heading but have also modernized the web design with an overlapping style that doesn't detract from the image.

      The on page information is laid out in an easy to skim fashion that doesn’t throw too much information at the reader.

      The Energizing Ontario blog is an important avenue that Hydro One uses to showcase it’s positive initiatives and community investments. In my redesign of the page, I’ve made it much simpler to search for specific blogs using filterizr.

      I’ve also increased the clarity of each blog card and enforced a strict character count for each card.

    sectionText: >-
      Before my arrival, the organization had never had an in-house UX Designer.
      It was my job to convince the executive team that a full-time web designer
      was worth the investment. I successfully proved the value of a designer,
      and got an extension on my contract.


      When I first arrived at Hydro One, a rebranding effort was underway. The current website was converted from the old red and black to teal, but otherwise, it was the same. All of my work stayed within the new brand colours, but I had the flexibility to interpret the existing brand and breathe new life into it. 


      Now as the digital manager, I’ve continued to put emphasis on simple, pragmatic solutions that are elegant. I've grown the team to include two full-time UX designer/developer positions. Using my position, I continue to strive for UX excellence by advocating for best practices and tools to further improve the experience for our customers.
