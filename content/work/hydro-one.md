summary: A﻿t Hydro One, I have proven the importance of UX and good design. I've
  unified the tips and tricks section, created numerous marketing campaign
  webpages and have strived to provide clarity to a misunderstood organization.

      **Example Page Design:**
      <https://www.figma.com/proto/QrlpWnH7QxHRNjLTV5lrg8/Applicance-%26-Energy-Savings-Tips?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2-61&viewport=1164%2C1217%2C0.41&scaling=min-zoom>


      **F﻿inal Page:** <https://www.hydroone.com/saving-money-and-energy/residential/tips-and-tools/appliances>


      The first set of pages I focused on was the tips and tricks section of the hydroone.com website. As I worked on the first page in the roster, Cooling tips and tricks, I scoured the website to find the similar elements between each and found a way to bring a consistent look to each page. These pages are featured in our monthly newsletter.


      <a href="#img1" id="img-1-link" class="lightbox-link"><img class="inline-image height-400" src="/assets/tips-masthead.png"/></a><a href="#img-1-link" class="lightbox" id="img1"><span style="background-image: url('/assets/tips-masthead.png')"></span></a>


      In each masthead, I've brought a consistent call to action, a clear heading but have also modernized the web design with an overlapping style that doesn't detract from the image. 


      <a href="#img2" id="img-2-link" class="lightbox-link"><img class="inline-image height-400" src="/assets/tips-icons.png"/></a><a href="#img-2-link" class="lightbox" id="img2"><span style="background-image: url('/assets/tips-icons.png')"></span></a>


      The on page information is laid out in an easy to skim fashion that doesn’t throw too much information at the reader.

    sectionText: >-
      Before my arrival, the organization had never had an in-house UX Designer.
      It was my job to convince the executive team that a full-time web designer
      was worth the investment.


      When I first arrived at Hydro One, a rebranding effort was underway. The current website was converted from the old red and black to teal, but otherwise, it was the same. All of my work stayed within the new brand colours, but I had the flexibility to interpret the existing brand and breathe new life into it. 


      As the digital manager, I’ve continued to put emphasis on simple, pragmatic solutions that are elegant.  I've grown the team since becoming manager to include two full-time UX designer/developer positions.
