The original version used an accordion style popout when clicking on book covers, which would shift elements on the page around. I liked the concept of drawing in users with the cover, so I changed the accordion to a simple [lightcase.js](https://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/) gallery lightbox.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/reads-1.png\" class=\"centered-image height-400\"/>\n\nBelow that, we included e-books and audio books by Bookboon. These proved to be super popular - our learners liked reading and listening at their own pace, so our team decided to turn it into a monthly program. Later on, it became the main focus of the page, so the order was flipped.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/reads-2.png\" class=\"centered-image height-400\"/>","sectionTitle":"TLA Reads"},{"sectionText":"This page is our landing page for LinkedIn Learning. It gives our users with access to the platform, provides helpful tutorial videos and has suggestions on what courses to check out.\n\n### Header\n\n<img src=\"/assets/original-lil.png\" class=\"centered-image height-400\"/>\n\nThe beautiful header graphic was designed by my colleague, Joe Morris. I integrated it as naturally as possible, leaving the left side to house our main and secondary CTA's. \n\nBelow the masthead, the initial design included copy to convince our learners to use LinkedIn Learning. To the right, the page displayed the \"Latest Features\", a carousel of courses that the TLA team updated bi-weekly.\n\nHowever as time went on, we discovered through **Google Analytics** that most users weren't interacting with our featured content. The page was simplified, and today it looks like this instead.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/new-lil.png\" class=\"centered-image height-400\"/> \n\nIn the initial design, the champions section was further down on the page, but it actually had more interactivity than the latest feature carousel. A champion is an employee that has submitted a course to be shared with fellow employees. The social nature of champions being able to share content reigned supreme over the latest features content and replaced it completely. We also shortened the copy as LinkedIn Learning became more popular with our learners, and added an in-page sticky navbar to let our users jump around the page with ease.\n\n### Learning Journeys\n\nThe TLA is backed by several deans who are high ranking employees from across our brands and collaborate with our team. The TLA's main purpose is to drive employees to keep learning. By using testimonials from our deans about on-going learning, we hope to reinforce that purpose.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/middle-lil.png\" class=\"centered-image height-400\"/> \n\nAs the user scrolls down the page, they'll find a list of benefits to using the LinkedIn Learning platform. Surprisingly, a number of our users were found to use the CTA at the bottom of the page, contrary to the usual heatmap patterns of a webpage. \n\n### Video Tutorials\n\nTo help our users troubleshoot LinkedIn Learning we send them to our video tutorials. Here, we've created videos on how to get started with the platform. \n\n<img src=\"/assets/end-lil.png\" class=\"centered-image height-400\"/> \n\nThe bottom CTA proves to catch any stragglers, and is notably popular with our users.","sectionTitle":"LinkedIn Learning"},{"sectionText":"In 2020, we organized our content by certain themes that change every quarter.
