Whilst taking Systems Analyst in college and <strong>IT</strong> in university, the majority of my peers didn't have a website to sell their skills to potential employers. I'm glad to say at least some of them listened and created their own online presence.</p>\n<p>But what about non-tech people? <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/26/why-every-job-seeker-should-have-a-personal-website-and-what-it-should-include/#3bcb0dea119e\">Here's a 2013 Forbes article on why everyone needs a website</a>. Controlling your first impression online is paramount to creating a professional image of yourself.</p>\n<p>Okay, I'll stop preaching and assume you're on board by now.</p>\n<h2>The Theme</h2>\n<p>Your first instinct is probably to gravitate to this thing you've heard about - <strong>WordPress</strong>. The platform was originally made for blogging, but a lot of organizations use it as a content management system because of how easy it is to use. The best part is the vast amount of customization because of themes and plugins. A lot of these are free, but a lot are not. If you're on a free hosting plan like x10hosting, you're probably not going to get any free theme pack-ins with your WordPress install. </p>\n<p>For the past couple of weeks I've been searching for a free theme to set up my cousin's website. I didn't want to put in a lot of work (he had a whopping budget of $0!), but the free themes I came across were frankly, ugly. Until I came across Colorlib's theme - <strong><a href=\"https://colorlib.com/wp/themes/shapely/\">Shapely</a></strong>. I was in love with the shape of it.</p>\n<p>Image</p>\n<p>It has a simple set up wizard that guides you through installing it's required plugins. I'm not a fan of page builders, but this one was bearable because it uses built in WordPress features to get the job done, decreasing the bloat. Their <a href=\"https://colorlib.com/shapely/\">demo</a> is a good showcase of it's capabilities. Personally I only used the parallax banner with a free stock image, and the contact form 7 widget.</p>\n<p>For my cousin's resume page, I used a Word to HTML online converter, and pasted it in. You can also just use the regular editor and paste it in straight from Word - I just wanted to refine the design a bit.</p>\n<p>After that, I just simply linked the resume page in the menu. There's also a feature to create a social media menu that automatically creates icons for you in the footer. <a href=\"https://colorlib.com/wp/support/shapely/\">Here's a link to the very helpful documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://chrissomai.x10host.com/\">This was how his site turned out</a>. Pretty great for the amount of time put in.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Plugins</h2>\n<p>Oh, and before you go, here's a list of plugins I think are <strong>essential</strong>. They're all free so don't worry!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\">Yoast SEO</a> - You need to control how your search results show up on Google. It's important!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\">WP Smush</a> - Decreases image size automatically. Smaller images = faster site.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\">Wordfence</a> - The bad thing about WordPress is that when left unchecked it becomes open to vulnerabilites. But Wordfence should help with that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://jasonsomai.com/contact\">Get in touch</a> if you need anything cleared up!
