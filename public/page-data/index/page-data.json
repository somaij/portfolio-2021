As a UX Developer at <a href=\"/work/triangle-learning-academy/\">Canadian Tire's Triangle Learning Academy</a>, I continually design and develop webpages that make consuming content easier for our learners. I take great pride in helping my fellow employees increase their own skillsets, and I'm always looking for ways to improve our platform. </p>\n<p>I also take on a variety of side projects to further enhance my design and development abilities, such as the site you find yourself on now, or the <a href=\"/work/islamic-forum-of-canada/\">website I designed for my friend's mosque</a>, or this site I made for my <a href=\"https://sarahjokhu.com/\">fianc√©</a>. In 2018 I took a <a href=\"/work/guideo/\">Brainstation User Experience Design course</a> that provided me with foundational UX knowledge that I continue to use everyday.</p>\n<p>I'm a huge car nerd, video game lover and I like to golf, poorly (okay at least that last one wasn't cliche).</p>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["175732641","3649515864","667404493"]}
